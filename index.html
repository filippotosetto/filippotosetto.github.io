<p>I am a London-based freelance iOS, watchOS, and tvOS Developer and mobile tech consultant.</p>
<p>I've been writing software for nearly 10 years with a wealth of experience with both big brands and small businesses.</p>
<p>I value top-notch design just as much as high-quality, well-architected code. I have a deep passion for UX design and a maniacal attention to details.</p>
