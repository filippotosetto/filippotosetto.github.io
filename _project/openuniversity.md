description: '<p>This is a research focused psychology app. The app collects data while the user plays the five <b>games</b>. Each game is designed to test a specific a different <b>cognitive ability</b>: working memory, split attention, vigilance, spatial processing and learning.</p><p>I used <b>SpriteKit</b> to implement the five different games, and <b>Parse SDK</b> to collect the data. The challenge in this project was to design the games, to understand how the score system would work and balance them in terms of timing and difficulty.</p>'
