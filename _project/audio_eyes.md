short-description: 'The app uses <b>iBeacons</b> technology to map the Information Age gallery in the London Science Museum. The project added a new layer of complexity to the usual development lifecycle. Beacon technology is in it infancy and to use it at a commercial level was one of the toughest challenge I ever encountered in my career.'
description: '<p>The app has been designed for <b>blind and partially sighted visitors</b>. It unlocks audio description of the <b>Information Age gallery at the London Science Museum</b>, it describe the environment, key objects and tactile display. <br />The app helps independent discovery - it does not give a step by step route, but responds to your movements in the gallery.</p><p>We used <b>iBeacons</b> technology to map the museum gallery. The project added a new layer of complexity to the usual development lifecycle, as not only we had to think about the problem from a software perspective, but also from a hardware one. <br />Understand how and why beacons signal interact with the environment, how the signal propagates around different materials like metal and glass, and how human body could disrupt the communications between the beacon and the phone.</p><p><b>Beacon</b> technology is in it infancy and to use it at a commercial level was a really tough challenge.</p>'
