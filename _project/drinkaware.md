description: '<p>The app tracks units and calories in drinks, reviews the user drinking patterns over time and allows the user to set specific goals and weak spots.<br />I have been working on the project since day zero. I managed the App architecture, the backend API design, and the big data analysis.</p> <p>The app uses <b>CoreData</b> as a persistent layer to store data offline; through <b>AFNetworking</b> the data is synched to an Heroku backend using <b>RESTfull API</b>. Weakspots are triggered using <b>geofence</b>, while a smart local notifications system is triggered based on the historical data inputed by the user. Finally clever algorithms calculates risk levels and calories based on drinks frequency and quantity.</p>'
