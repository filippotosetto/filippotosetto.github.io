<!-- <p>I am a London-based freelance iOS, watchOS, and tvOS Developer and mobile tech consultant.</p>
<p>I've been writing software for nearly 10 years with a wealth of experience with both big brands and small businesses.</p>
<p>I value top-notch design just as much as high-quality, well-architected code. I have a deep passion for UX design and a maniacal attention to details.</p> -->

# Tech Lead
As Tech Lead I'm involved in the whole project lifecycle. From first contact with the client, discovery phase, gathering requirements and translating them into technical tasks, time estimate, software architecture, hands on development and finally app store submission.<br /> I strongly believe a good tech lead needs to have not only great communication skills towards the client, but also towards the team. Understanding each developer skill set, strength point and weaknesses, is a must to deliver a great product. 

# Lead iOS Developer
As Lead iOS developer my primary job is to write well crafted code. I have almost 10 years experience as a developer. I'm not afraid of challenges but in the same time I'm quite good at taming expectations. I believe I have a creative way of thinking, that helps me tackle hard problems in a non conventional way. <br />I do love working in a team, to exchange ideas is a great way to see a problem from a different perspective. <br /> Finally, as senior member of the team, I love mentoring junior developers, to give them advices, to review their code and, why not, to learn something from each one of them.
